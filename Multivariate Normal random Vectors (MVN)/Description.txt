Sample 500 images of the digit "7" from the MNIST dataset. 
Compute the empirical mean "u" and the empirical covariance "S". 
Consider the random vector X in R^784, with X ~ MVN(u; S). 
Show u as well as the 16 e-vectors associated with the largest e-values. 
Sample 16 images from this distribution using.
Note: you might need to re-scale the e-vectors before plotting as they are of unit norm. 
Truly, it doesn't work so well in the sense that the samples of "7" do not look like real samples drawn by hand.

work is needed to obtain realistic samples.
